Employee Task Management Dashboard

A modern and responsive Employee Task Management System built with React + Tailwind CSS. It provides separate dashboards for Admin and Employees where:

Admin can log in, create tasks, and assign them to employees.

Employees can log in to view, track, and update their assigned tasks.

Task statistics like Active, New, Completed, and Failed are displayed in a clean dashboard.

All data is persisted using LocalStorage for simplicity.
